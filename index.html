                  <p> Quiz Me! is a 1st party voice-forward trivia skill powered by Alexa's own Knowledge Graph. Players can test their knowledge across thousands of dynamically generated and engaging categories.

                     <br>
                        I really like this game. We plan it on long drives-- so traffic doesn't bother us as much. I love movie trivia and there are lots of variations in this game-- as well as a lot of other types of categories. I only wish there was a list of the available categories somewhere. I figured out that I can say: "Quiz me on movies from the 1930's" (or 40's, 50's, etc. or you can ask to be quizzed on movies from specific directors or specific actors.
                        In a couple of instances the skill had some issues: a few times it read the questions in Spanish instead of english and sometimes it says it does not have a category that I know it has because I've played it already. But the problems are not often.

                  <p> The Dictionary Game, the popular parlor game, can now be played online with friends! Trick your friends into guessing for your made-up definition to an obscure word and see if you can spot the correct definition among the crowd. Players can use their phones, tablets or laptops to play together in real-time. At least 2 players are required to play, but the more players join the harder and crazier it becomes to get your friends to vote for your definition.

                  <p> Unbalanced is a side-view action puzzle game where players must strategically move around an ever-tilting world in order to restore balance. The catch: everything in the game has weight. Players must figure out how to balance a board with moving enemies, objects, and even their own weight as they traverse the levels. Players will have visual feedback with the physical tilt of the board and meter on the X axis that indicate if the board is successfully balanced. Controlling a handy robot, BEE-3, players can shock enemies and move weighted objects to change the boardâ€™s tilt to balance the level. </p>
