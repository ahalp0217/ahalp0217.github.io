               <h3>Quiz Me‚ùó</h3>

               <p>
                  Quiz Me! was a 1st party voice-forward trivia skill powered by
                  Alexa's own Knowledge Graph. Players could test their
                  knowledge across thousands of dynamically generated and
                  engaging categories. Featured at the 2019 Game Developers
                  Conference.
               </p>

               <h5>‚≠ê Five Star Reviewer ‚≠ê</h5>
               <p>
                  "I really like this game. We plan it on long drives-- so
                  traffic doesn't bother us as much. I love movie trivia and
                  there are lots of variations in this game-- as well as a lot
                  of other types of categories. I only wish there was a list of
                  the available categories somewhere. I figured out that I can
                  say: "Quiz me on movies from the 1930's" (or 40's, 50's, etc.
                  or you can ask to be quizzed on movies from specific directors
                  or specific actors. In a couple of instances the skill had
                  some issues: a few times it read the questions in Spanish
                  instead of english and sometimes it says it does not have a
                  category that I know it has because I've played it already.
                  But the problems are not often."

               <h3>üìô The Dictionary Game</h3>

               <p>
                  The Dictionary Game, the popular parlor game, can now be
                  played online with friends! Trick your friends into guessing
                  for your made-up definition to an obscure word and see if you
                  can spot the correct definition among the crowd. Players can
                  use their phones, tablets or laptops to play together in
                  real-time. At least 2 players are required to play, but the
                  more players join the harder and crazier it becomes to get
                  your friends to vote for your definition. Entrant in the 2018
                  International Game Festival.
